# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Unemployment-in-Hong-Kong
In this project, we performed time series analysis on the unemployment statistics in Hong Kong.
This data set is from Census and Statistics Department of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from 1982 to 2018.
However, we only choose data from January 1982 to January 2018 as the research object.
You can download the data set from https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/home/index.jsp.

We finally achieved the best model with seasonal ARIMA (2,1, 2) (0, 0, 2)[12].
